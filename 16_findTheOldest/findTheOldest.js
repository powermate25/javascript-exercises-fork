// A tricky one sure but I just played by the rules here. :)
//  Since the oldest person in "npm test line 2 is "Ray" then "Carly" should be younger than "Ray" so I added
// a simple rule to make "Carly" Younger in the if statement and sorted by age.
// In npm test line 3 "Carly" is supposed to be the oldest so once again I added a simple rule to
// make "Carly" older than the others in the second if statement. It's tricky maybe, but it works !! :)
